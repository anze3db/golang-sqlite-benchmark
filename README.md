# golang-sqlite-benchmark

This is a benchmark server for testing the performance and stability of SQLite in Go. It's based on my Django benchmark and uses the same requests. To run the benchmark server, you need to have Go installed. Then, you can run the following command:

```bash
go run server.go
```

To run the locust server head over to [django-sqlite-dblock](https://github.com/anze3db/django-sqlite-dblock) and run the locust server from there (the golang server uses the same port).
